# Excel Financial Data Connector (Index Constituent UDFs)

## Introduction

### This project implements a robust and performant system that exposes powerful financial data retrieval capabilities directly within Microsoft Excel via User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The system is designed to allow financial analysts to query structured financial index constituent data (including weights, sector, and market capitalization category) using simple, formula-based syntax directly in an Excel cell, simulating a seamless integration experience.
